They dont accept credit cards, CASH N NETS card ONLY, no wechat, no alipay, no grab pay. They accept orders from foodpanda. I called my husband and he was on the way to bring cash for me. I beg them for ordering first and pay later, they said no. It was 1pm, I didnt have breakfast, my husband needed another 30mins to arrive. Of course I had no reason to accuse them of anything, but theoratically, I can order from foodpanda, in that case they will lose commission to foodpanda. I was fed up by their attitude, so I just left, paid myself delicious food in a nice restaurant with my credit card.",0.5913,0.457,0.2905,0.468,0.4346

Straits Chinese Restaurant,"#01-01, 133 Amoy St, Singapore 049962",Arnold Ho,"Dishonest service. TLDR; Ran out of main dish but forced us to pay for side dish that wasn't even served yet because she couldn't cancel the side dish in the system. Obviously a lie as she could cancel the main dish in the system. At 1245pm, we ordered the large main dish fish head curry for the 3 of us and traditional Chinese tea. The older chinese waitress suggested we order a smaller fish head curry size and more side dishes. We declined but at the egging of the older waitress, we added a small side dish of otah. Less than 3min after, she came back and said they ran out of fish heads, pls order other dishes. The fish head curry was the highlight, we decided to cancel, come back another time and head elsewhere for lunch. However, the waitress insisted again just to order other dishes. We declined but she said she couldn't cancel the side dish in the system. We ended up paying and taking out the otah (16 dollars x 2) and tea. It's OBVIOUSLY LYING that she couldn't cancel the otah entry in the system - because she could cancel the main entry of fish head curry.",0.5826,0.4142,0.3122,0.4493,0.4125

Told the waiter the issue, and he came back saying they do not allow changes to the order, evidently failing to understand what went wrong. After some to and fro with his colleagues, he once again came to say they do not allow changes since I have started eating the meal. I explained this does not make sense - I only realised it's the wrong order after I tried to scoop for seafood. They only offered to recook after 5 to 10 mins, by which time we had to run so I gave up. The pork also had a stale taste.",0.5781,0.4879,0.253,0.4781,0.3797

Kitchen by Food Rebel,"#01-01, 133 Amoy St, Singapore 049962",Andre Rubin,"Food was not horrible, but service was the worst I experienced in Singapore. They have separate menus for weekdays and weekends, but I ended up ordering from the menu page that had no day limitations. The owner was taking my order was she was insisting to let me know how wrong I was in ordering from the wrong menu (even though there was no date limitation on it). However, she took my order from the apparent wrong menu anyway. A few minutes later, they bring my food, and it was not what I ordered. That's fine, people make mistakes sometimes, no worries. So I repeated what I ordered and I got the same ""you are ordering from the wrong menu spiel"" and that somehow, I needed to pay more for the same food I was having. They came to my table three times to let me know that I was doing something wrong! (all the while, ordering from the menu that had no date limitation)! Horrible service. Never coming back.

Their signature sambal fish was very dry. Just wonder how can this be a signature dish! Cereal dishes were dry. Place was warm as can see several customers, including myself, wiping off the sweat.

Sides and appetizers are about $8 each before GST. Hence a small cucumber salad or potato salad will set you back $8.56 each. Asahi draft is expensive. About $10.50 after GST for a small mug. Better to go with the high-balls which are similarly priced. No before and after HH prices btw. This restaurant also charges $3 for charcoal PER person. To me this charge is baffling. If using charcoal is their USP, why charge the customer? I don't see any Korean BBQ joints charging consumers for the gas stoves! This restaurant also charges you a credit card fee of about 5%. Seriously? In this time and age? The food is OK. But please don't antagonize your customers with these charges...",0.5664,0.448,0.2962,0.4033,0.3972

The rice was mushy (cause they used fresh rice) and did not have the wok hei smell which is essential for fried rice. The black sauce they gave was very mediocre, coupled with the frozen seafood used in the fried rice gave it a bad smell... I thought that perhaps I ordered something wrongly, so I tried the gyoza, which seemed to be one of the popular dish. Though it's not terrible, it literally tastes like the frozen gyoza bought from NTUC and pan fried. Overall, I will never return again.

Service: Really terrible service as they do not have the basic courtesy of reminding you that they need the table back after 2 hours when you first get to the restaurant or while making a second order. So we were told that they needed the table back at 9:00pm at 9:01pm. By then, we were just halfway into a second pizza which was ordered at 8:15pm and arrived at 8:45pm. The excuse? Oh, it was indicated when you made an online reservation. So I went to check my reservation and it was in fine print. Even if it was indicated in fine print, I've never had a restaurant that doesn't give the heads-up when you first arrive. The solution? Oh, you can pack your remaining pizza or we can try to find you space at the bar. By then, we really had no appetite and just paid for the bill and left. Food: Average but overpriced. I don't usually give bad reviews to a restaurant just solely on the service but the food couldn't save its service. Plenty of good pizzas around now, you really don't have to come here.

GAIG RESTAURANT,"1 Boon Tat St, Singapore 069611",Nigel Moy,Can only say we were very disappointed with Gaig. The 3 stars are because the food was good if overpriced. Downsides to the food were that the vegetable platter was pickled without any indication it was going to be and the prawns that went with the squid ink Paella were all head and tail. The real disappointment and the reason we will not return there was the complete lack of atmosphere and engagement from the staff. It really felt as though they could not care less whether we enjoyed the evening or not. The lady manager/owner was (granted she had lost her voice) miserable and competent indifferent.

The restaurant staff perhaps did not think they could advise their patrons to be more well behaved leaving many tables of patrons annoyed and upset. The rackus started as early as 7:30pm until that big group left (near 9:30pm). Before they left, a couple came in with the baby (in a stroller) and I thought to myself...it's not a good idea at all! Baby would get shocked by inconsiderate patrons. Things I think the restaurant needs to work on/u need to know before u decide to come: 1. Restaurant doesn't accept reservations after 7pm. 2. Restaurant does not manage inappropriate behaviour of patrons (your enjoyment of food could be MAJORLY affected and no one would be able to compensate u for that).

She made us pick a random Chinese character. I do not expect this kind of behavior of a proper restaurant with automatic service charge. The food was not good either. Tasted full of MSG or whatever other cheap ingredients. $30 for one tiger beer and two plates of random noodles., great selection of appetisers. Service: excellent.

Fish with belly half cut was proudly displayed in the narrow counter table where behind some used bowls lyinf around. The sashimi chef also touched the tab and passed to a waiter. Later I saw him moving around used dishbowls and touching aircon remote. I find this is extremley unhygenic and I feel like vomiting in the evening. I will never go back again.

I was too flustered at the time to respond appropriately but it was really irresponsible for a restaurant that promotes itself as a health conscious/organic place that clearly labels which foods have gluten to serve gluten when gluten free food was ordered. I cannot eat gluten because of a health condition. This was the first time I was eating out in 3 months. My friends and I had specifically chosen this place because it offered gluten free options. I understand mistakes are made sometimes but am disappointed that the restaurant would compromise a patron's health in this way and not offer any compensation. To be fair, everything else was fine.

Three of us went and only one ordered dumpling soup. They served one bowl of soup but in the end the receipt showed that there were 3 bowls of soups served. It turned out that the one bowl was equivalent to 3 bowls of soup. But the other two didn't order dumpling soup at all! Horrible. And this wasn't the first time we encountered such treatment. We specified this time that we wanted only one bowl but they still counted as 3 servings. I guess it was done on purpose and was not a communication error as we had believed the last time we came. Although 1 serving of dumpling soup is only $1, the fact that we were charged with additional $2 for the other 2 servings which we didn't order made us feel cheated. They would have earned a lot more from such sales tactic throughout the day from all customers... I feel unfair. To all customers, please think thrice before you decide to order dumpling soup, especially if you are in a group. You may unknowingly raise the cost of other people eating with you. You may also want to try EMPHASISING that you only want ONE SERVING of soup for ONE person. Just in case.",0.4561,0.4623,0.3192,0.4416,0.4576

Literally tastefully done skewers even though I would prefer tenderer meat in most cases, but I guess this is what brings the characteristics of a skewed meat, very much commendable I must say. We went on to order our favorite beef bone marrow, and we really like how those bread came with it, so soft and tender on the inside keeping the crisp on the external (or skin) layer (bread is nice on its own, of course the bone marrow is perfect for us-needless to say).

They use plastic bowl which is bigger than normal soup stall. The soup is nice and not too salty. They claim no msg added. They don't let you chope seat but you confirm will get one after ordering and paying for the food, so you just need to queue directly for the food. You don't get to choose where to sit.If you sit inside, it gets pretty hot as the soup is boiling hot and the place is very crowded.

Straits Chinese Restaurant,"115 Amoy St, #01-01, Singapore 069935",Zhiting Wu,"Not sure how this restaurant earns its 5 star reviews but I personally felt that the food was not good. Bought the fave coupon for Ala cart buffet and most of the food tasted bad except for the hainanese pork cutlet which was crispy and the sauce tasted yummy. The coconut milk in the Sayur lodeh was on the verge of turning sour, babi ponteh tasted like a massive pouring of dark soya sauce and the babi satay.. We had no idea why is it called that except that there was pork drenched in a curry lookalike sauce. Ikan Manis was actually sweet and sour fish fillet (disappointed) but at least the fish filet tasted relatively fresh. Overall, the dishes doesn't taste much like nonya food. Not sure if it's cos we bought the coupon and the food tasted like that. But service was excellent. The waitresses who served us were very attentive and friendly and they definitely did a great job making sure we had sufficient drinks throughout.

Portions were also incredibly small, especially bearing in mind the price of the dishes.

Fat to meat ratio was also just right to make it a mouth watering amount of juiciness. After the renovationthe menu changed Duroc Pork.

Almost no give, and the texture was closer to a stale cracker than anything resembling yeasted dough. Maybe we got an overworked batch, or it's a pizza style that I've never encountered. It doesn't resemble a Neapolitan, New York, Chicago, or anything in between. Honestly surprised by the rave reviews. Ordered the Black Magic which was supposed to contain black truffle cream, but there was no flavour to be found. Maybe they used old truffles. They might have been better off using flavoured oils instead if they can't use up fresh batches fast enough. To their credit, the staff were friendly and helpful. It's a shame about the quality of the pizzas. They didn't ask questions when we returned almost a full pan back to the kitchen, so I'm not sure if it's because they too knew it was substandard. You can find infinitely better pies at this price point, and we're not wanting for reasonably good pizzerias here. Can't recommend this place to anyone.",0.4267,0.3839,0.3261,0.358,0.5013

They wrote happy anniversary in chocolate on the plate but that's about it. What a let down. 3) dessert was mandarin sorbet and peanut soup. It was super simple and tasty but disappointing that such a fine dining establishment had no pastry chef!! Was definitely expecting something more complex and intricate 4) the main male waiter while knowledgable had incredibly bad breath. Each time he knelt down to explain the wine pairings I had to hold my breath, it was so bad. Service was good but small details like this really counts. Overall decent but I wouldn't return.

If you want a cosy environment for a quick lunch, this is indeed the place to try. One might walk pass and if you take a look inside, you would be wow by their exquisite renovations but.... what we found out was their price is surprisingly slightly lower than the few F&B around that area (Really a great find!). Their set lunch is only $18++ for Soup of the day, main course of Pasta/Burger and Coffee/tea. With the good dining environment, it is certainly a good place to drop by if you want to move away from the crowded hawker and have a lunch discussion with your colleagues or client.",0.4216,0.3807,0.459,0.4125,0.5533

My friend thought the Beef Tongue Taco was EVEN BETTER though. We ordered two types of Tacos:Beef Tongue and Pulled Pork, and he said the Beef Tongue was hands down the best. (And even better than the Apollo Quesadilla!!!) But I am thinking he only thought that cos he ate the quesadilla last and was probably full by then hahaha. Mid-range pricey.

A sizeable portion of chicken, the meat was not too tough. I also had the honey soya boneless fried chicken ($22). This was amazingly good. The pieces were not greasy and fried to perfection. This dish went well with the banchan that was provided free of charge. There were crunchy beansprouts, kimchi and sweet beancurd skin.

Many of the yakisoba I have tried tends to be oily. Not thos one! The noodles are fried al dente with veggies and topped with a perfect bull's eye. The egg is done to my liking, wobbly yolk sitting on crispy white. So good! The restaurant decoration is simpleand chic. Ideal place for after work catch ups, drinks with buddies or an all girls evening catch up. There is a sizeable private dining area with attached bathroom. Its a nice cozy corner. I got to see it as the manager kindly let me use the private room bathroom when the other bathroom was occupied.

Service was 5 stars friendly, attentive and prompt. And just two of them! The gyoza was out of this world. The bill was just $85.92 for three of us.

You generally feel awkward going in with shorts because everyone's well dressed. So first tip is to dress well. I don't want you to feel like a bum. Let's get to the food. Good. Not mind blowing but good. Their custom fries is unique and is a meal by itself. The beverage menu is adequate. The pizza, thankfully all thin crust, is adequately good but the taste was very different the three times I had them. I really enjoyed their original 5 cheese (where the quality was consistent), which they are famous for you can't go wrong with that one if you need a suggestion. However the vegetarian options are a little wanting. They don't do half and half so don't ask. But I wish they did let you customise it a bit beyond the set menu.

I couldn't thank them enough for accommodating to our request. We had the loveliest time up there and their happy hour, being in the CBD area, was to die for.

Portions are very decent with three giant prawns in the laksa and mee siam. Good selection of local kuih for dessert too.

Most of the time I come for breakfast. At the begging, I happened to pay 8.50 or 12$ for the same dish. Depends on who was serving me. When I raised the info, not so much effort was made. I understood with a look at the menu that you can build the same dish but the price will be different just on how you enunciate it. Now, problem solved and I pay 8.50 for the breakfast that I want. Now about the food. As I said, ingredients are REALLY top quality. However, going healthy doesn't have to mean tasteless. Seasoning should be revised even just the basic salt/pepper. I only ordered once for lunch. Same remark, even though the quality is there, the taste in extremely plain. I will not repeat. Overall, I truly feel the passion for good products and healthy food here. Nevertheless, the global taste of each dishes I have tried could have been a complete different experience with just a bit more cooking knowledge. Pricing is a bit high, but I do not mind for good products. What stop me for going more often is really the plain taste of everything. This place has a HUGE potential.

Originally recommended by my Korean friend who mentioned it as possibly best in Singapore, the meat is aged for 15 days and cooked by staff who ensure optimal temperature and golden grilled meats. The pork belly flavour is deep, juicy and well matched with the assortment of condiments they provide, including mountain garlic, a leaf to wrap the meat. Apparently this is often offered at premium k-bbq outlets, or so my Korean friend says. While the price line is a tad steep, one would not be complaining when leaving the stall for the satisfaction they offer to customers with such premium meats.

SWEE KEE EATING HOUSE,"137 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068602",Clarice Mok,"I've read mixed reviews about this place, and decided to give it a go. There were really hits and misses with this place. Main thoughts were, the fish soup REALLY CANNOT MAKE IT. There is no way this can be their signature dish. IT WAS WAY TOO FISHY - the soup, after leaving it out cold, was like literally the raw fish smell/taste at the wet market. Neither could the San Lor Hor Fun and the Braised Tofu, and Kai Lan. These were the real MISSES of the entire order. PLEASE AVOID at all costs. The prawn paste chicken was alright, but definitely have tasted better, especially at JB Ah Meng. The chicken was not as tender as the ones sold at JB Ah Meng. But of course, it can't be all that bad. I really liked the sweet and sour pork, achar and the moonlight hor fun! The sweet and sour pork had the right balance in flavour, and the fried pork retained a little crispness from the fried batter. The Achar was spicy and sweet, though I would have liked it if it was colder. Moonlight Hor Fun was pretty similar to Char Kuay Teow, except the yolk gave it additional moisture, which I appreciated. Honourable mention would be the Fuyong egg, because while many people may say it's just egg, but I really like that this wasn't bland. Many zichar places I've been had eggs that were WAYYY too eggy or too bland for my liking. This really had a nice balance. Overall, though there were more misses than hits, there were dishes that I liked, mainly the Achar, Moonlight Hor Fun, Sweet & Sour Pork and Fuyong Egg. AVOID THE SIGNATURE FISH SOUP, SAN LOR HOR FUN, BRAISED TOFU AND STIR FRY KAILAN!!, shop concept felt like I was back in Korea.

Not quite what I'd hoped from a restaurant with a Michelin star next to its name. Firstly the levels of sodium used in the dishes was far beyond 'well seasoned'. I started with the artichokes and had trout for the main course. The first dish was pleasant but lacked depth. Needed some acidity , not more salt. The second course las laden with salt. Almost unpalatable. I shared some steak with my wife and it was also quite heavily seasoned. Lastly , I ordered the goats cheese sweet, which just didn't work. I seldom review but this one needed it.

French fries (chips) were a tad burnt/dry, but was crispy like - chips. Burger was just so-very awesome. Can feel the 'meat' inside the patty and the way it's grounded is not the kind that make mince meat. Feels like pulled pork style but on beef. Anyway the burger is awesome. Worth it. Ice tea was not sweet and I love it. All in all, I'll come back again to try other stuff.

Do note that the prices for the dinner menu are more expensive than lunch. I had the ginseng chicken soup ($18). This was very hearty and warming for a cold rainy day. A sizeable portion of chicken, the meat was not too tough. I also had the honey soya boneless fried chicken ($22). This was amazingly good. The pieces were not greasy and fried to perfection. This dish went well with the banchan that was provided free of charge. There were crunchy beansprouts, kimchi and sweet beancurd skin. I also had the moscato soju, which is really green grapes flavour ($16). This went well with the fried chicken. Overall, I would highly recommend this place.

Fotia,"161 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068615",Amanda Chng,"While I personally don't fancy Greek food - this restaurant serves authentic and delicious Greek food. The service was alright and the food was well done. We had the lamb platter and moussaka and Greek salad. People that previously reviewed say the portions are small but I thought they were big and filling. The fries on the platter were done very well, crispy and fresh. I only wished they offered vegetarian moussaka options- or options to serve the moussaka without the ground beef. (For beef lovers- it was alot of beef and I had a lot of trouble separating the beef from the potatoes and eggplant) I personally don't like the taste of land meat but I really wanted moussaka (bechamel and eggplant and potatoes) because It was what I always ate in Greece. I think though that different restaurants do their moussaka differently-so I don't want to fault fotia based on my personal preferences. I personally like my moussaka with loads of eggplant and minimal potatoes. My regret after eating there is not ordering the fish! Haha but whenever I order fish at Greek restaurants in Singapore, I find the fish very dry.. so I didn't want to risk it. Anyways. I Would visit again for sure in a bigger group This time for the dips!:) the couches look comfy for sure.

A special mention of the sommelier team who we spoke with at length; they knew their wines and presented a really refreshing and original line up of wines that I would have never chosen myself. The food was outstanding as well; an oyster like I've never eaten it before, Sri Lankan curry but done very differently than expected , all dishes were done with the best ingredients and minimal fuss.

Kitchen by Food Rebel,"167-169 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068618",Strumpf Kasten,"Have been there for breakfast. The restaurant is located in Downtown. That might be the reason for these relatively high prices. The portions are small. The taste is good but nothing special. I've recently been in Thailand and Indonesia where you get much more for half the price. I've ordered an Omelette with spring onions and herbs. The omelette was served without any bread or other decoration. Just the pure egg. And even the spring onions and herbs I have to look for as they were really rare. Additionally I've had the homemade granola with coconut yoghurt and fresh fruits. The fruits were just dragon fruit. Nothing more. Would have expected more. The taste was good. But all in all the whole breakfast hasn't had the value of around 19 (!!) $. But maybe these are normal SNG prices. The staff was really friendly. Nothing to complain. Oh, and one last thing. I'm not sure but I haven't seen that there'll be 10% service fee charged afterwards. Maybe I was blind. But if not; you should add it to your menu as side note.",0.3851,0.3,0.3848,0.3518,0.5343

Raku Raku ticks both these boxes and is a very authentic Japanese restaurant experience. Right down to the Japanese tv shows playing on TV's hanging on the walls. The staff were efficient and resourceful as they even helped ask the Chef to make a dish we'd ask for (kaki fried oyster) that wasn't on the menu. The food overall was pretty good but not amazing, we had beef cubes which were tasty but a little hard. And the sashimi was fresh but not outstanding. Having said that the night was fun as the drinks flowed and the atmosphere was one of working people enjoying a good night out to unwind with friends. It was a little noisy, but that was part of the charm. The price was also pretty reasonable so if you want a fun night out with no frills, be sure to give Raku Raku a try.",0.3748,0.3135,0.4426,0.3414,0.5969

Ordered a medium rare filet mignon (tenderloin) and was rendered speechless. It was AMAZING. Cut through like butter, like biting into a meat sponge, melts in mouth like cotton candy. Really a perfect score. 2. They've mastered everything else. Perfect scallops. Perfect turkey. Perfect sauces. Perfect vegetables. Perfect desserts. What more can I say? Everything I've had was just the best. 3. Very very cosy ambience. Comfortable chairs. Impeccable service. Friendly and polite staff. My take?

Bolognese like that is traditionally served on fresh tagliatelle, and at Sons, you get handmade ones right behind their kitchen. Of particular mention would be their Casarecce with Truffle Pesto & Porcini Mushrooms. The handmade Casarecce is perfectly al dente, with its hollow twists trapping the aromatic truffle pesto. One would have thought the mushrooms wouldn't shine through the strong flavors of the truffle pesto, but they use such fresh porcinis that the sweet juiciness of it pairs so well with the sauce.

My wife's mussels were excellent with a wonderful white wine/tomato sauce with lots of garlic and parsley. For mains, the seafood stew (cacciucco) was rich and packed to the brim with fresh and well-cooked (ie not overcooked) seafood. The fillet of beef with fegato was generous, tender and flavourful. All of it was accompanied by an excellent Brunello di Montepulciano. Choosing a dessert was difficult given that all options sounded good. In the end we went with the tiramisu which was smooth and wasn't overpowered by too much coffee or marsala as is the case sometimes. However, as good as the food was, the true highlight was the warm and professional service from the staff which made the experience even better!

Chao Ting,"20 Cross St, #01-31 China Square Central, Singapore 048422",Keng Oei Quek,"Classic old school dish. The stock is subtle and complex , the dish itself follows the Teochew fish porriage style with the rice cooked in it for a short while so as to keep the whole dish warmer and let the stock mix with the rice. The egg floss is also harder to find nowadays. With the rice crisp, the entire dish is a mix of texture, and wonderfully tasteful stock which may need some seasoning to bring it out (I have a salty palette). Not to detract from the dish itself, firstly the location is considered as open air even though it is sheltered (ie no aircon) and secondly, they should offer bean paste sauce as well as it is the original complement to this dish.",0.3638,0.3322,0.3884,0.3032,0.5655

Ushidoki Wagyu Kaiseki,"204 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068640",Alvin Hoon,"Much has been said about the beef here, but it's the remarkable skill and taste of Chef who brings out the true flavour of the meat through his preparation and cooking. Chef acheives a great harmony of flavours for each and every course. It is obvious much thought and effort went into creating each and every dish of beef he serves. Yes, the beef is excellent and almost anyone can grill a piece of meat. But to create so many flavour (and texture)f combinations just one meat is truly mind blowing. I was reluctant and almost sad to swallow each bite, because it means the end of the wonderful explosion of flavours in my mouth.

The only reason for the 4 stars versus 5 stars is because of the hours, which are limiting (close at 10pm on a Friday??). I think they have a great product and they're in a lively place.

Best I can describe it is, ""scattered"", like the various ingredients are separated, i.e. the ""Tofu in Dashi"", where is the ""Dashi"" stock? Wrapped up in seaweed and fried batter, underwhelming taste. And the chilli sauce, think bland THW dimsum chilli paste. Imagine how it goes together.

Server came on cue to take our orders which were delivered promptly. Had perfectly prepared lamb, sizzled outside, pink and juicy inside with very fresh vegetables.
